### 🕐 0:15 - 0:20 | Inspiration: What Can We Create?
- Show **examples** of simple **website games** 
  - 🐋 [Sea Creature Speed Game](https://alysonla.github.io/sea-creature-speed/)
  - ❓ [Fruit Emoji Matching Game](https://alysonla.github.io/matching-game/)
  - 🐶 [Puppy Sunshine Spam Game](https://alysonla.github.io/puppy-sunshine-game/)
- Ask:
  - **"Who has made a website before?"**
  - **"What is a website made of?"**  
    - 🏗 **HTML** = The bones (structure)
    - 🎨 **CSS** = The skin & clothes (colors, fonts, layout)
    - 🧠 **JavaScript** = The brain (makes things move and interact)
  - **"What are hex codes?""**
    - Hex codes are special color codes made of six numbers and letters that computers use to know exactly what color to show on a screen! 🎨💻

## Optional ✨ 

## Intro to GitHub: Hosting Your Game

🎥 See video tutorial [here](https://www.loom.com/share/b6e0712c95604d3a91db5ce4bfa46d0d). 

### 🌐 What is GitHub?
GitHub is like **a magic folder** where you save and share your website.

### 📁 Create a GitHub Repository:
1. Go to **[GitHub.com](https://github.com/)** & login
2. Click **Repositories** → **New**.
3. Name the game (e.g., `car-race-game`).
4. ✅ Check **"Add a README file."**
5. Click **Create Repository**.

### ⬆️ Uploading Code to GitHub

### 📜 Copy the game code from Claude.ai.

### 🖥 On GitHub:
1. Click **"Add File"** → **"Create new file."**
2. Name it **index.html**.
3. **Paste the code**.
4. Click **Commit** (Green Button).

### 🚀 Now make it live!
1. Click on **Settings** (top right of repo).
2. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**.
3. Under **"Branch,"** select **main** and hit **"Save."**
4. The website will take a few minutes to "deploy" so go play your game once and come back. 
5. At the top of your setting pages you will see the link for your website! 
6. 🎉 **Your website is now live!** **Share the link with friends!** 🌍

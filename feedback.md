# Workshop Feedback 

> My son had his very first coding experience at Alyson’s AI Coding Workshop, and it was AMAZING! The hour-long session was just right—long enough to build something meaningful but short enough to hold his attention completely. Alyson made everything so kid-friendly and fun, and she was fantastic at breaking down coding concepts for beginners.
By the end, my son had built his very own racing game! He was so proud and couldn’t stop showing everyone what he created. It’s been days, and he’s still talking about it!
If your kiddos are curious about coding or just love games, definitely check out Alyson’s AI Coding Workshop. She’s fantastic with kids and makes tech accessible even for complete beginners. It’s not just about coding—it’s about building confidence and sparking curiosity about how technology works. Seriously, one of the best activities we’ve tried this year! :heart:

> Max had a lot of fun and would be interested in doing more. He said it was better than coding club because they are actually doing things on computers.
